Whoa... just... Novocaine, right? Okay, so just walked out and yo, my head is still spinning. Like, you know when you've had just a little too much cotton candy and popcorn, and everything feels kinda sticky and surreal? That's me right now. Anyway, there was this guy–Steve Martin? With that vibe like your uncle who tells weird jokes at Thanksgiving but somehow pulls off serious too.

Right, the theater was PACKED. And noisy. People rustling popcorn bags like they were auditioning for some weird ASMR gig. Think my back is permanently molded to those seats now. Not sure why they make ‘em so uncomfortable. It's a conspiracy... i swear.

Did you see the “𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ” thing they were promoting at the start? Like why bother with that reminder, Imelda from work asked me to save it for her but I can't even remember the name of the app LOL.

> The scenes... jumbled in my brain. Dentist office with vibes like ‘this is definitely not covered by your insurance', and then there was Helena Bonham Carter, she's like a raccoon in human form, you know? Mischievous and you just can't look away. Some sort of madness brews in every room she’s in. Felt my popcorn crumbs had more sense by the end.

Steve Martin, he’s... like a jazz tune at odd hours. Sometimes smooth, sometimes unexpected. His expressions flip faster than pancakes at a slow diner on Sunday morning.

Remembered this weird moment, this lady next to me dropped her drink—like a tsunami of soda under our seats midway. Smelled like despair and Pepsi. And then snap, back to Steve Martin trying to... um... solve the thing? God, was there a thing to solve? Absolutely had to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to catch the plot points I missed like slippery fish.

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , they said, it's a trip, they said. Like a kaleidoscope of a really mundane nightmare that you secretly like.

function accidentalPaste() {
    if (brain === mush) {
        return Hit play again;
    } else {
        return I'm still in that seat era;
    }
}

Anyway, that’s my brain dump on Novocaine. Catch ya when I wake up from this weird cinema trance.
